# Survey Collection - Noise, Blur, Color/Grayscale
This section contains the code for replicating the human surveys.
Requires: Lab.js, JATOS, MTurk

## Step1: Loading the json file
Visit https://labjs.felixhenninger.com/ and upload any of the json files present in this folder to lab.js online builder. It directly replicates the survey ran for experiments. You can then view various components used in the survey and change/modify any particular pieces of code required. 

## Step2: Test survey
The survey can be tested by playing the play button in the builder(https://labjs.felixhenninger.com/). 

## Step3: Deploy the survey 
The survey can be deployed via multiple ways. 
We first host the survey on JATOS(Just Another Tool for Online Studies) and then use MTurk functionality on it so that it could be deployed for various demographics.
